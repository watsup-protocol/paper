\subsection{Weaknesses}

The WATSUP protocol as described in this paper still suffers from some existing security issues. Current common implementations of asymmetric encryption schemes are vulnerable to offline attacks \cite{Blumenthal:2007}. Additionally, if the user chooses a weak base password, the base password may be susceptible to offline dictionary attacks. Both of these attacks are only possible if an attacker obtains a nonce encrypted with a client's public key, or the attacker obtains the public key itself. Even with alternate asymmetric encryption algorithms, the attacker can still perform an offline dictionary attack if they also capture the plaintext nonce; the attack would perform a standard dictionary attack but then generate a public key for each candidate password using the WATSUP's protocol. If any public key decrypts the encrypted nonce and results in the unencrypted nonce, the attack knows the correct password. Alternately, with current encryption schemes, man-in-the-middle attacks are still possible with the WATSUP protocol. These weaknesses can be eliminated by using HTTPS, but the user still has some guarantees using HTTP.

Another weakness is a denial-of-service attack against the login protocol. An attacker could rapidly request nonces for a target user. Depending on the server implementation, a request may invalidate previous nonces, so the target may be unable to log in.

The WATSUP protocol also does not protect a user from themselves. In order for the WATSUP protocol to provide portable access to online content, a user's private key is reproducible using the user's username and password for a given host. Therefore, if a user loses their password through some social engineering attack for example, their accounts will still be vulnerable. This also means that online dictionary attacks are still a threat if users employ weak base passwords. We do not propose WATSUP as a replacement for good password hygiene. Users should still use good practices, such as different passwords on each site and using high entropy passwords.

\subsection{Future Work}

Before WATSUP is ready for public use, it needs to be improved and thoroughly vetted by security experts. A major concern is that the protocol relies on the server to produce a cryptographic nonce. Our threat model does not allow for trust of the server. Therefore, we propose using POSIX time in milliseconds as a nonce. As long as the round trip time between client and server is greater than one millisecond, and the server is correctly providing the time, this nonce will be unique, and hence adequate for cryptographic use. This allows the client to audit the server's compliance.

Another direction that could be explored is that of mutual authentication based on a trust-on-first-use system. This would provides the user with server authenticity guarantees, which could be critical in the event of HTTPS public key infrastructure compromise. To solve this, one model is that the user saves the server's public key, but this means the user would need to save the server's public key on each of their devices. Another model is that the user signs the server's public key, which the server saves and reissues to the user on each connection, but this makes revocation in the event of server compromise difficult or impossible. In either model, the server would perform authentication similar to the client authentication.

\subsection{Conclusion}

The WATSUP protocol provides web authentication with guarantees for users and reduces the exposure of their passwords. Because the protocol never stores or transmits passwords, users are guaranteed that their cleartext passwords will not be stolen during transit or authentication or from the server. Perhaps most importantly, this protocol does not require a user to trust any server.
