\noindent User passwords are regularly compromised through failures of trusted web servers. Most approaches to solve password problems involve improving server security, improving client practices, or replacing passwords altogether. However, these approaches are not always practical or achievable. In many cases, the undetectable negligence of server owners impedes security improvements. We propose Web Authentication without Transmitting or Storing User Passwords (WATSUP), a new application-layer web protocol to replace standard website authentication, without requiring trust in any server or third party. WATSUP is designed to be auditable, in that a client can always detect if the server incorrectly implements the protocol. WATSUP is secure against eavesdropping and spoofing, even if the communication or server database is compromised. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of WATSUP, and we discuss the weaknesses and necessary improvements prior to deployment.
